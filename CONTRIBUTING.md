## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up
django-channels-handlers for local
development.

1. Fork the django-channels-handlers repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/django-channels-handlers.git
```

3. Install development dependencies and initialize pre-commit
```bash
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

4. Create a branch for local development:
```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```
    
5. Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that the tests are still passing:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:
1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, and
    for PyPy. Check
    <https://travis-ci.org/joshua-s/django-channels-handlers/pull_requests>
    and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:
```bash
pytest channels_handlers
```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.

Make sure to add an entry to HISTORY.md. Then run:
```bash
poetry version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
```

After doing this, commit your changes. Then run
the following:
```
git tag -a <version: vX.X.X>
git push --follow-tags
```

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
